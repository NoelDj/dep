<h1>How to change svg color in an img tag</h1>
<div class="calculator">
<p>When you're working in graphic design, you're often going to need to change the color of your SVG images. This is easy enough to do, but there are a few things to be aware of when changing colors that can prevent any problems from happening! This article will cover how you can change the color of an SVG image as well as some best practices for doing so.</p>

<h3>Can you change the fill of an SVG in an IMG tag?</h3>
<p>No, you cannot. SVG is an image format and not a color format, so this would be impossible. <br>
SVG is a vector format and not a pixel-based one. This means that it can only display shapes, lines, text and other vector graphics—not images or photos.<br>
It's used for icons and logos rather than photos because of its file size—it's usually much smaller than other high-quality image formats like PDFs or PNGs.

<h3>How do I change the dynamic color in SVG?</h3>
<p>The natural question is: How do I change dynamic color in SVG?<br>
The answer is that you can't. SVG's are static graphics, and they don't have animation capabilities. The closest thing to dynamic colors would be to use a tag within your SVG file and then change out that symbol from another document with different colors or transparencies or whatever other properties you want. However, this will cause a lot of duplication in terms of code size on the page because each time the symbol changes its shape, it must also be updated on all pages where it's used as well (this isn't exactly what happens but that's how we need to think about it).

<h3>How do I change the color of an SVG path?</h3>
<p>In order to change the color of an SVG path, you will use the strokeStyle property. You can also use the following properties in combination with the strokeStyle property:</p>
<ul>
  <li>StrokeWidth - The stroke width of a line segment or polygon outline. A value of zero (0) means no stroke. If both values are zero, there is no outline.</li>
  <li>LineWidth - Defines how wide lines are drawn within a shape by specifying an absolute value or a percentage relative to the current viewport size. A value less than 1 creates thin lines; greater than 1 creates thick lines; other values create medium width lines on systems with device-pixel ratio of 1/960 = 96%</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I SVG an image in HTML?</h3>
<p>Let's use the following code example to discuss how to SVG an image in HTML:<br>
You can change the color of your SVG using the fill attribute, which accepts CSS color values like red or #FF00CC. It's also possible to change the opacity of your SVG using fill-opacity (fill with 50% opacity). The stroke-width attribute allows you to control how thick or thin a line should be when applied around an element. Stroke-linecap controls whether or not there will be no cap at all on lines that are drawn—no matter what kind of line it is—or if a different type of cap should be used instead (round or square for instance). Stroke-linejoin defines how two lines will meet at intersections where multiple paths meet each other.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>So, in the end, we have learned that it is possible to change SVG color using img tag. As we have seen, this method does not require any kind of external library or framework, which makes it very easy to use and integrate into your website. You can try out different colors for different SVG objects in your images or use it as a way to highlight certain parts of an image without having to add CSS styles or other markup elements in order to achieve the desired effect.</p>
